            <p>After two sold out performances in a row, the best Russian Rock Band in New Zealand Hit Pump will return in June for a massive show on one of Aotearoa‚Äôs most iconic live music venues.
              ‚ÄúWe want to do something that no one has ever done before, and most likely never will ...‚Äù
              It was hard to imagine that one and only Russian-speaking rock band in New Zealand would perform on the same stage as the world-famous artists. Even in their wildest dreams, the guys could not imagine that in 4 years time, they would perform at The Powerstation! A venue with a 1000+ capacity, powerful sound and video capabilities.
              Hit Pump has built a reputation for head-spinning live shows. This time they are advancing the show production even more to make it truly unforgettable.
              ‚ÄúPowerstation is an ambitious target. The show production is in full swing. We are working on a production of this scale for the first time but there are no doubts that it will be an epic concert!‚Äù</p>

            <p>We are excited to announce ‚ÄúNo Way Out‚Äù 18 October 2019 - the unique audio and visual experience performed by Hit Pump, 
            the best Russian Rock cover band in New Zealand. This time we will take you back to the days of the legendary 
            Leningrad Rock Club, the first legal rock-club which allowed Soviet rock to surface from underground clubs,
             private apartments and samizdat tapes to wider audiences. The club was first formed in 1981 under General 
             Secretary of Communist Party of the Soviet Union - Leonid Brezhnev and supervised by the KGB 
             to prevent music critical of the party from reaching the public. We‚Äôll get you singing to Akvarium,
              Viktor Tsoi (Kino), Alisa; they all rose to popularity on the club‚Äôs stage.</p>
