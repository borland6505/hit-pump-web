            <p>Dear friends, we want to start this decade from what is likely to become the largest social gathering event
             in the history of the Russian speaking community in New Zealand!
              We are playing our live show ‚ÄúOn Fire‚Äù  at one of Aotearoa‚Äôs most iconic live music venues, Powerstation,
               on Friday 15 May. Kilowatts of high-quality sound will be passed through your ears in one of the best venues in Auckland. 
               We will be singing our favourite hits that will bring you warm memories from the past. Or, if you are new to Russian music,
                this will be a display of the best what this scene has to offer.</p>

            <p>We are excited to announce ‚ÄúNo Way Out‚Äù 18 October 2019 - the unique audio and visual experience performed by Hit Pump, 
            the best Russian Rock cover band in New Zealand. This time we will take you back to the days of the legendary 
            Leningrad Rock Club, the first legal rock-club which allowed Soviet rock to surface from underground clubs,
             private apartments and samizdat tapes to wider audiences. The club was first formed in 1981 under General 
             Secretary of Communist Party of the Soviet Union - Leonid Brezhnev and supervised by the KGB 
             to prevent music critical of the party from reaching the public. We‚Äôll get you singing to Akvarium,
              Viktor Tsoi (Kino), Alisa; they all rose to popularity on the club‚Äôs stage.</p>

        Hit Pump was established in May 2018 by Konstantin Sigachev and Ilya Black in Auckland.

        In October 2019 Hit Pump with their current members performed live and gathered over
        450 guests and many more could not get in because the show was Sold Out!
        They have built a reputation for head-spinning live shows and continue to develop and experiment with different genres.
        They are playing at Powerstation in May 2020 with a special guest Russian- Kiwi singer Marina Bloom.
        ‚ÄúMusic is a universal language, there is no need to understand the words when the band rocks!‚Äù
        Band‚Äôs current members are Ilya Black (vocals), Konstantin Sigachev (guitars/vocals), Igor Plotnikov (guitars), Eugene Marikhin
        (bass), Vladimir Sbitnev (drums).
